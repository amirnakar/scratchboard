I don't want to spoil it but my biggest problem was the inconsistency: the hero ditches his whole life philosophy several times and not for good reasons and characters make huge impact and are then forgotten about, only to be used again to badly tie their own loose ends. This inconsistency and loose-ends make this story seem thoughtless and carelessly written.<br/><br/>The other 2 stories are about the future after the revolt. they are much shorter and are thus less damaged by inconsistencies (though still not very well done). The best part about these is the insight into the world of technology and engineering, seen through the eyes of a former military engineer.<br/><br/>Generally this is the brightest spot in this book - Heinlein, a former army engineer, writes compellingly about rocketry, space, flight and underground excavations. He appears to both understand the issues of trying to live on an airless, gravity-free asteroid and offer futuristic plausible solutions for them.

On the other hand, the stories are told by a ""simple"" narrator in Watson, its short-story format makes the problems be solved simply and succinctly and finally, its told in a ""simpler"" time and setting. They go around in horse-drawn chalices, EVERYBODY smokes and there are no cellphones. this makes things very simple and approachable, but very complex - and that duality is what makes it great.<br/><br/>Cheers to sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/>He had me gripped for a story each time and made me think harder than I expected to try and solve his unsolvable puzzles",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Specifically it's about understanding day-to-day life in a concentration camp.<br/>Being both Israeli and a direct descendant of a holocaust survivor, I know quite a lot about the subject.  I've been to Auschwitz and Birkenau and all over Poland, I've studied the subject in school and in my spare time.  So this book simply didn't shock or amaze me.<br/><br/>The first and larger part of the book is basically about Victor Frankel's view of life in several concentration and work camps.  Being a psychiatrist, Frankel has a ""cold"" and clinical way of looking at things. The stories and conclusions are very interesting, shocking, hard to understand and thought provoking - to those who experience them for the first time.<br/><br/>The second part of the book (which is much shorter and more instructional) discusses Logotherapy, which is a school of psychiatry using goals and wishes to motivate and give meaning to life.<br/><br/>Overall this book probably deserves between 3 and 4 stars. I heard of many people who were ""changed"" by it, but I already know all the stories and horrors of the Holocaust, so it just didn't ""do"" it to me.",,,1,,,1,,,Acceptable,,

I always remembered this book as being diapointing, not funny and generally very sad and unworthy.<br/><br/>Re-reading it today (7 years later) I can say that it's really a great book.<br/>It really is a bit darker and deeper than the rest of the series.  The jokes are still there and the humour is sharp and satirical as always.  There are a couple of extra edges to this book.<br/>First, the matter of science (this applies to all D.A books, but this one especially) is a major theme and is as always explained in simple, funny and clever ways (reverse temporal engineering, multi-dimensional perceptions, sandwich making...)<br/>Second, Adams seemed to have finally captured real emotion and behavour.  This for me has always been the trouble with these books.  I really don't want to spoil too much, but there are some very understandable feelings of loss, despair, loneliness, worry and feeling not-in-the-right-place that are really very well written, moving and relateable.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a strong finish to a great series.  All the knots are nicely tied in the end, the quality hasn't diminished too much from the first book and the style, as always, is excellent.<br/><br/>I can't give it a 5 because I'm saving those for really special books, so 4 well deserved stars for this one.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
