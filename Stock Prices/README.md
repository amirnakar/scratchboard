# The idea

I want to try and practice my Machine Learning skills on financial data
To do so, I wanted to try and use a dataset of 100 variables to predict some stock prices.
I thought of trying to predict medical/Agri stocks, so I chose: 

1. TEVA     [TEVA]
2. Bayer    [BAYRY]
3. Pfizer   [PFE]
4. Protalyx [PLX]
5. Kamada   [KMDA]

Don't use because they're either private or owned by something bigger: 
Netafim, ADAMA

I thought of using these parameters: 
Dollar, Euro, Shekel prices
Major stock market indicators: NASDAQ
Specific stocks like "top-30 pharma"
Weather indicators like amount of rain in NYC (this is to see if it will be excluded)
